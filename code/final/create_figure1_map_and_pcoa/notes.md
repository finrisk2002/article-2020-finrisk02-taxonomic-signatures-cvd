Leo: Add the relevant parts for Figure 1 to this repo. See code/final/main.R and code/final/create_figure1_map_and_pcoa/setup.R for setting things up in a way that is similar to how I and Ville did things. In case it is of some use, the directory code/final/PCA/ contains the some code I adapted from your "color dots in PCoA by dominant genus" code for my PCA figures. --Aaro
