1. Installed Anvi'o and samtools

2. Built Bowtie2 database from VFDB FASTA using Anvi'o
   bowtie2-build VFDB_setB_nt.fas VFDB_for_bowtie2

3. Copied example files from Atlas with copyatlas.R 

4. Construct sample file (samples.txt) with construct_sample_file.R

5. Map FINRISK reads to VFDB (Bowtie built version)
   ./mapping.txt -> Generates BAM files

6. Analyse coverage and depth of the BAM files
   ./coverage.sh

6. Interpret the resulting BAM files with main.R
